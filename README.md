# OneShotTimer
Fast&amp;Easy , set a method to execute on set delay or interval.


As i write much code for Rust-Umod-Plugins, i got somewhat used to their libraries Timers,
and liked the easy use of them, so i tried to make my own class that somewhat acts similar and feels same on usage.

So, this one is it.

Usage:

 _ = new OST(Thisone,3);
 
 Where "Thisone"  is a public static void with no arguments.
 
 I assume its beeing static + no arguments is needed, but i did no testing whatsoever.
 Feel free to use and/or improove the code :D
